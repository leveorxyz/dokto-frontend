          My registration authorizes me to use Dokto services as provided in this agreement. It is my duty to be truthful and accurate with all the information I enter into or upload to the system. I acknowledge that I understand that any misrepresentations about the patient’s condition may result in serious harm to me or others. The law requires that every medical diagnostic or treatment encounter be documented. I may also use Dokto’s EMR/EHR services to store other important medical information pertaining to my current health, medical condition and my health history. While my account with Dokto is active and in good standing, I will have unlimited access to medical information, stored in the Dokto app and the medical records database.

          By accepting this Agreement, I am granted a non-transferable license subject to the terms of this Agreement to use Dokto services. In order to be valid, my account must contain certain required true, correct and verifiable information about my identity and medical history. In order to maintain access to Dokto services, and in order for Dokto to provide me important information regarding my medical treatment and my health, it is my responsibility to update my personal account information and to notify Dokto of any changes in my home address, e-mail address, telephone number, or guardian or emergency contact. My failure to do so may result in interruption of service or Dokto’s inability to deliver to me important time-sensitive information about my medical condition, medications, laboratory and diagnostic test results. I may update my personal information by accessing my registration information through the Dokto Website by logging in with my username and password.

          Dokto’s telemedicine consults are provided by clinicians dedicated to the safe and effective, evidence-based practice of telemedicine. I choose to enter into a clinician-patient relationship with Dokto’s clinicians. I agree to have my medical history and other diagnostic and medical documentation reviewed by one of Dokto’s clinicians. I acknowledge that Dokto’s clinicians may choose not to treat my condition or prescribe medication for my condition. Dokto’s clinicians do not prescribe DEA controlled substances, non-therapeutic drugs and certain other drugs which may be harmful because of their potential for abuse. Dokto’s clinicians reserve the right to deny care for potential misuse of services. Dokto operates subject to state regulation and may not be available in certain states.

          For individuals who are under age 18, a parent or legal guardian must accept this Agreement and on his or her behalf. I agree at all times not to falsify or misrepresent my identity or my authority to act on behalf of another person. I also agree to not attempt or facilitate to attack or undermine the security of the integrity of the systems or networks of Dokto, the software provider or any of its authorized agents or affiliates.

          I understand that Dokto should never be used for urgent matters. Therefore, for all urgent matters that I believe may immediately affect my health or well-being, I will, without delay, go to the emergency department of a local hospita.

          Dokto makes the consultation report available for you to review to ensure that relevant signs and symptoms of a patient&apos;s presenting complaint are accurately documented and that you understand the treatment decision and instructions issued by the Dokto health care provider. I am advised to immediately contact Dokto if I disagree with or do not understand the contents of the consultation report or the instructions issued by the treating Dokto health care provider.
          I understand that Dokto clinicians or staff may send me messages. These messages may contain information that is important to my health and medical care. It is my responsibility to monitor these messages. By entering my valid and functional e-mail address and mobile phone number, I have enabled Dokto to notify me of messages sent to my Dokto Inbox. I will update my e-mail address on Dokto as needed. I agree not to hold Dokto or its authorized vendors and agents liable for any loss, injury or claims of any kind resulting from Dokto messages that I fail to read in a timely manner. I understand that contents of any message may be stored in my permanent health record. I agree that all communication will be in regard to my own health condition(s). I understand that asking for advice on behalf of another person could potentially be harmful and is a violation of the Dokto’s Terms and Conditions. Dokto and its clinicians do not assume any responsibility for health information or services used by persons other than the primary account holder.
